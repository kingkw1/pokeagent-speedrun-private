Opener Bot - STATEFUL State Machine for Game Opening (Splits 0-4)

This module implements a STATEFUL rule-based controller that reliably handles
the deterministic opening sequence of Pokemon Emerald, from title screen through
starter selection.

===============================================================================
ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
===============================================================================

**State Machine Design:**
- STATEFUL: Bot remembers current state (self.current_state_name)
- Each frame, only checks transition conditions from current state
- Prevents state oscillation (e.g., S6_NAV_TO_CLOCK ↔ S8_NAV_OUT_OF_HOUSE)
- States use explicit next_state_fn to define completion criteria

**Signal Hierarchy:**
1. PRIMARY: Memory state (milestones, game_state) - 100% reliable
2. SECONDARY: Visual elements (text_box_visible) - 85% reliable  
3. TERTIARY: VLM text parsing - 60% reliable (hint only)

**State Lifecycle:**
```
Title Screen → Name Selection → House Interior → Exit House → 
Choose Starter → Exit Lab → COMPLETED
```

**COMPLETED State Behavior:**
Once STARTER_CHOSEN milestone is achieved AND player exits Birch's Lab,
the bot transitions to COMPLETED state and PERMANENTLY hands off to VLM.

The bot will NOT re-activate even if player returns to lab later. This is
intentional to prevent interference with normal gameplay after the opening.

===============================================================================
USAGE
===============================================================================

The opener_bot is called from action.py as Priority 0 (before all other logic):

```python
# In action_step():
opener_bot = get_opener_bot()
if opener_bot.should_handle(state_data, visual_data):
    action = opener_bot.get_action(state_data, visual_data)
    if action:
        return action  # Bot handles this step
# Otherwise, fall through to VLM navigation
```

Once COMPLETED, should_handle() always returns False, permanently handing off
control to the VLM-based agent.
