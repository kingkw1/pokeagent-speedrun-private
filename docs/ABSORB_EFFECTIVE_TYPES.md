Here is a categorized list of Pokemon that a player may encounter on the way to the first gym in Pokémon Emerald, divided into two groups based on the effectiveness of the Grass-type move "Absorb." The "Not-Effective" category includes Pokémon types for which Absorb is not very effective (Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, Grass, Dragon, Steel). Everything else is in the "Effective" category, which includes Pokémon types weak or neutral to Absorb (including Rock-type Pokémon in the Rustboro Gym that absorb absorb well).
