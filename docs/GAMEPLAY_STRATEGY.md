### Optional But Helpful Steps

- Pick up Poké Balls or items in Poké Marts, houses, Berry patches, etc. (not strictly needed unless your Pokémon faints or you want to catch extra Pokémon)
- Speak with NPCs for extra Running Shoes, healing items, or TMs (e.g., HM01 Cut in Cutter’s House: Cut cannot be used until after you have the badge)
- Fight extra wild Pokémon to level up your party for easier battles, but grinding is not strictly required if you can defeat the necessary opponents.
- Catch additional Pokémon to assist in battles or for type advantages. The starting Pokémon alone can defeat all mandatory opponents with enough luck or skill.
