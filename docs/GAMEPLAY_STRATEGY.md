To reach and defeat the first Gym Leader (Roxanne) in Pokémon Emerald and receive the Stone Badge, only a specific subset of actions are strictly required, with many common activities being optional for speedrunning. Below is a list of absolutely necessary steps, clearly marking optional actions that help but are not strictly required.

### Required Steps to Obtain Stone Badge

1. Complete the introductory sequence
   - Set the clock in your new room and meet your neighbor (Professor Birch's child).
   - OPTIONAL: Potion in computer

2. Rescue Professor Birch
   - On Route 101, choose a starter Pokémon and battle the wild Zigzagoon.

3. Battle your Rival on Route 103
   - Go north to Route 103 and defeat May/Brendan in your first rival battle. This is necessary to progress.

4. Receive the Pokédex and Poké Balls
   - Follow the rival back to Birch’s Lab; get Pokédex and 5 Poké Balls.

5. (?SKIPPABLE?) Receive Running Shoes and proceed west
   - Get Running Shoes from Mom to allow faster movement. (RUNNING SHOES DON'T HELP WITH AGENT/EMULATOR)

6. Reach Petalburg City via Route 102
   - Travel through Route 102 westward, entering Petalburg City.
   - OPTIONAL: Grind on trainers along the way
   - OPTIONAL: Buy potions & repel

7. Assist Wally in catching a Pokémon
   - At Petalburg Gym, help Wally catch his first Pokémon (Ralts) with Norman's Zigzagoon.

8. Proceed to Rustboro City via Route 104 and Petalburg Woods
   - Head west on Route 104, pass through Petalburg Woods (defeat Team Aqua grunt attacking the Devon researcher).

9. Enter Rustboro City and access the Gym
   - Head north to Rustboro City; you do not need to visit any other buildings for badge progression.

10. Defeat Roxanne, the Gym Leader
    - Enter Rustboro Gym and defeat Roxanne in a battle to earn the Stone Badge.

### Optional But Helpful Steps

- Pick up Poké Balls or items in Poké Marts, houses, Berry patches, etc. (not strictly needed unless your Pokémon faints or you want to catch extra Pokémon)
- Speak with NPCs for extra Running Shoes, healing items, or TMs (e.g., HM01 Cut in Cutter’s House: Cut cannot be used until after you have the badge)
- Fight extra wild Pokémon to level up your party for easier battles, but grinding is not strictly required if you can defeat the necessary opponents.
- Catch additional Pokémon to assist in battles or for type advantages. The starting Pokémon alone can defeat all mandatory opponents with enough luck or skill.

Only perform extra actions as needed for your agent’s speedrun strategy or safety; all strictly required events are noted above. Optional actions can help, but skipping them may reduce time if battles can be completed reliably.
