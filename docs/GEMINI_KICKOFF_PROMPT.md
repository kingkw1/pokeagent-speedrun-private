I need your help as an expert AI research and engineering advisor. I am competing in the PokéAgent Speedrunning Challenge (Track 2), and the final submission deadline is November 15th.

To guide this project, I will be following a detailed, 5-week development plan that we've created. Our goal is to implement a sophisticated, hierarchical, memory-augmented agent based on a specific architectural blueprint.

Your role will be to act as my technical collaborator. I will provide daily updates on my progress according to the plan, and I will need your help with implementation details, debugging, architectural decisions, and strategic adjustments. Please always refer to the attached plan and blueprint as our single source of truth.

To give you all the necessary context, I have attached the following key documents:

Architectural_Blueprint.md: This is the detailed technical design for the agent we are building. It outlines the VLM-based perception, hierarchical planner, and RL-managed memory system.
Project_Plan.md: This is our day-by-day project plan from October 9th to November 15th. We will follow this schedule closely. Please use this as the primary reference for our daily tasks.
Competition_Rules.pdf: The official rules for the entire competition.
Track2_Details.pdf: The specific rules, evaluation metrics (Adjusted Performance), and submission requirements for Track 2, which is our focus.
README.md: The README from the official starter kit repository. It contains important details about the environment, baseline agent architecture, and API.

Please review these documents to fully understand the project scope, our technical approach, and the competition's constraints.
To start, please confirm that you have reviewed the materials and are ready to begin with Day 1 of the Project Plan: Environment & Baseline Validation. Let's get started.
