## Testing Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (affects main story progression)
1. Route 101 ↔ Littleroot Town portal coordinates
2. Route 101 ↔ Oldale Town portal coordinates
3. Oldale Town ↔ Route 103 portal coordinates
4. Oldale Town ↔ Route 102 portal coordinates
5. Route 102 ↔ Petalburg City portal coordinates

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (common buildings)
1. Pokemon Center doors (all locations)
2. Gym doors (Petalburg, Rustboro)
3. Birch's Lab coordinates

### LOW PRIORITY (one-time interactions)
1. Player's House internal coordinates
2. May's House internal coordinates
3. Trainer positions (already confirmed from gameplay script)

---

## How to Verify Coordinates

1. **Portal Exit Coords**: Stand on the tile and note position before crossing
2. **Portal Entry Coords**: Note position immediately after crossing
3. **Warp Tiles**: Stand on door/entrance tile and note exact position
4. **Interior Doors**: Note position when inside building near exit

## Coordinate Logging Template

```
Location: [LOCATION_NAME]
Portal Type: [open_world / warp_tile]
From → To: [FROM_LOCATION] → [TO_LOCATION]
Exit Coords (before crossing): (x, y)
Entry Coords (after crossing): (x, y)
Direction: [north/south/east/west/interact]
Notes: [any special observations]
```

## Update Procedure

When coordinates are verified:
1. Update this document (change ⚠️ to ✅)
2. Update `agent/location_graph.py` with verified coordinates
3. Run `python agent/location_graph.py` to validate
4. Test pathfinding with updated coordinates
