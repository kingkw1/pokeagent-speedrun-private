MANUAL SCRIPTED TEST - Proves the system works

Sends button commands directly via server API (headless mode)
The server will process the action queue and execute the buttons

Sequence: A, A, UP, UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN
Expected: After 2 A presses, at least ONE directional input should move the player
